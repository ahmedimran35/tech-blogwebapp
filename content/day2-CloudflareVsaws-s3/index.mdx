## Hey everyone!

If you're trying to decide between Amazon S3 and Cloudflare R2 for cloud storage, here are some insights that might help you make the right choice.

### Free Tier

#### Cloudflare R2:

- 🆓 **10GB of free storage per month**: This is double what Amazon S3 offers, making it attractive for small users or projects.
- ⚠️ Fewer free operations compared to Amazon S3, which may be a consideration if your use case involves a lot of data processing.

#### Amazon S3:

- 🆓 **5GB of free storage**: While half of what Cloudflare R2 offers, it's still a good starting point.
- 📈 More free operations: Amazon S3 provides more free POST (Class A) and GET (Class B) requests, which can be beneficial for users who have many data operations.

### Pricing Beyond Free Tier

#### Storage Costs:

- 💰 **Cloudflare R2**: $0.015 per GB per month. This makes Cloudflare R2 cheaper for storage compared to Amazon S3.
