This scalability is particularly useful for businesses that experience rapid growth or have fluctuating storage needs. Although all of the other object storage also provides this kind of facility, R2 gives versatility .

**Durability:** Cloudflare ensures that your data stored in R2 is highly durable .They use advanced techniques like Reed-Solomon erasure coding to protect your data against hardware failures, disk crashes, and even entire data center outages. This level of durability gives you peace of mind, knowing that your valuable data is safe and secure.
